* refactor create and totext into non ::CLI components

* better filtering for create command

* docs

* a catalyst based in-the-browser editor (low priority)

* http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/ support (downloading, linking)

* the 'scrub' command to auto hide threads, clean subjects, etc

* switch the HTML generator to use HTML::Element based templating, and allow
  post processing (extract body, strip divs, etc) with the --small and --body
  options.

* make the HTML output skip lists with only hidden threads

* fix the totext bullet rewrapping by making a Text::Quoted like module for
  parsing bullets (Text::Autoformat is just too insane)
